# CS250

To interpret a users' needs and effectively implement them one must understand the reason for those needs. Understanding the needs will help in creating user stories that target the desired result. User stories are essential to the agile method, also the use of daily scrum meetings are both things I hope to use in the future when developing as they are efficient even in solo projects.

A good team member is one who understands his role, is timely, participates in meetings, and gets work done on time.
